# Vue Mapbox Demo  

> Vue demo for Mapbox Nativescript plugin

This is a basic vue-cli nativescript application that follows the patterns in the [nativescript-google-maps-sdk](https://github.com/dapriett/nativescript-google-maps-sdk/tree/master/demo-vue) vue demo, as well as in [this tutorial](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/include-feature-rich-maps-in-a-nativescript-vue-app-with-mapbox) by Nic Raboy.

To run this demo you must first build the plugin.

```
cd ../src
npm run build.dist
```

then you can run the demo on a connected device or emulator

```
tns run android
```
-or-
```
tns run ios
```
